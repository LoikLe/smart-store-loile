## Data Warehouse (P4)

This module stores cleaned sales, product, and customer data in a SQLite database (smart_sales.db). Data is extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) from pre-processed CSV files into three main tables: customer, product, and sale, for direct querying or integration with business intelligence tools.

### Running the ETL Script

To create the database, tables, and insert data from the cleaned CSV files, run the following command:

```shell
py scripts\etl_to_dw.py
```

## Power BI (P3)

This module is about learning how to work with large amounts of data using tools like Power BI and Apache Spark. It looks at how cloud platforms and big data processing come together to help us analyze and visualize data faster and more efficiently.

## SQL Queries and Reports

The queries below are used to sort top customers by their total spending: 

```shell
= Odbc.Query("dsn=SmartSalesDSN", "SELECT c.name, SUM(s.sale_amount) AS total_spent
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC")
```

## Design Choices

The dashboard was created with the following goals in mind:

- Key Metrics: I highlighted important metrics such as total sales, top customers, and how sales changed across different dates so that the information is easy to understand.
- User-Driven Exploration: I used filters for regions, categories, and time ranges to let users explore the data in different ways.
- Effective Visuals: I chose to use bar charts and line graphs to clearly show trends and how values change over time.

## P6: BI Insights and Storytelling

Three key objectives shaped the direction of this project:
1. Total Sales by Preferred Contact Method
2. Top Performing Products Category by Region
3. Total Sales by Month and Products

This analysis aims to assess sales performance from multiple perspectives, such as contact methods, product categories by region, monthly trends, and individual product performance. These insights are critical for optimizing customer outreach, regional product focus, and inventory management. By identifying which contact methods drive higher sales, understanding top-performing product categories in each region, and tracking monthly and product-level sales, the business can make more informed decisions in marketing strategies and operational efficiency.

### Data Source
The data used in this analysis was sourced from the Smart Store Database (smart_sales.db). The following tables and columns were used:

sales table:
- sale_date: The date of the sale.
- sale_amount: Total dollar amount of the transaction.
- customer_id: Identifier for the customer.
- product_id: Identifier for the product sold.

products table:
- product_id: Unique product identifier.
- category: Classification of the product.

customers table:
- customer_id: Identifier for the customer.
- preferred_contact_method: Customerâ€™s preferred communication channel (call, email, etc.).
- region: Geographic region of the customer.

### Tools
Tools Used:
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used to create meaningful visualizations, including bar charts and line graphs.
- Pandas: Essential for data manipulation, aggregation, and performing OLAP-style transformations.
- Python: The primary language used for analysis, data processing, and generating visualizations.
- VSCode: Integrated development environment used for writing Python scripts, querying the SQLite database, and visualizing the results.
- SQLite: Used to manage and extract structured data from the Smart Sales Database.

### Workflow & Logic
Visualizations generated during the analysis include:
1. Sales by Contact Method: Pie chart showing how different methods contribute to overall sales.
2. Category Sales by Region: Log-scaled bar chart showing the performance of product categories by region.
3. Monthly Sales Trend: Line graph showing total sales per month, with individual product performance insights.

### Suggested Business Action

- Marketing and Outreach: Direct marketing and customer outreach efforts toward the most effective contact methods based on sales performance.
- Product Stocking and Promotion: Tailor product stocking and promotional strategies based on regional performance, with a focus on high-performing categories
- Forecasting and Resource Allocation: Use monthly sales trends for forecasting future sales and adjusting inventory or marketing strategies for high and low seasons.
- Promotional Campaigns: Highlight top-selling products in upcoming campaigns to capitalize on their proven demand.

### Challenges
Several challenges arose during the analysis, including:

- Data Integrity Issues: Ensuring accurate joins across the sales, products, and customers tables was difficult, especially with mismatched keys or missing records. These issues were addressed by carefully cleaning the data and verifying column names.
- Designing Visualizations: Handling many categories and regions in visualizations was challenging. Customization techniques were used to ensure clarity and readability while displaying all the relevant data.
